		<p class="name">Ethan Winters</p>
		<p class="description">One of the few survivors of the Baker Incident, husband of Mia Winters, and father of Rose Winters. Ethan had hoped relocation would get him away from the craziness of Bioterrorism, but fate had another plan in mind. Just as things seemed somewhat normal, he loses his wife and has his daughter kidnapped. What for? He doesn't know.</p>

		<p class="description">Ethan's wife and Rose's mother. Unlike Ethan, Mia would prefer to forget what happened at the Baker estate. However, something about her seems off. Much like last time, Ethan feels like he is being played of sorts. </p>
