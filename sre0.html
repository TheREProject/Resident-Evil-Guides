		<p>It's been six years since Leon's escape from Raccoon City. No long a police officer, Kennedy is now an agent of the United States Government. His first mission as an agent is to search for and Rescue the president's daughter, Ashley Graham. She was kidnapped on her way back home from college by an unknown party. Reports have indicated that she was last seen in a secluded rural village in Western Europe (Spain but not Spain). Leon is sent to the area to investigate. But what he encounters is not exactly what he was hoping for.</p>
