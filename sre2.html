	<div class="summary">
		<p>September 29th 1998, two months after the Mansion Incident, Rookie Police Office Leon Scott Kennedy drove into Raccoon City. While driving along the empty road, he noticed a flock of crows feasting on a human corpse. Blocks away, a truck driver is puzzled as to why a crazed man would bite him at random. Back to Leon, he stepped out of his patrol car to investigate. To the rookie's surprise, the corpse began to animate, grabbing the man's shoe. Leon had no choice but to shoot his would be assailant. Just then, more walking corpses approached the gunfire forcing Leon to fire at the group, taking note that they are withstanding shots that would normally take a human down. He made his way down an alley where he met a young woman and saved her from a threat behind her. </p>  

		<p>Leon and the woman ran through the streets and find a police car to use. Once buckeled up, they made their way towards the Police Station where we learn that the woman is named Claire Redfield, and she's searching for her brother Chris. Leon had Claire check the glove compartment to which she found a gun. To the duo's surprise, there was a zombie in the back seat. Through very lucky circumstances, the car crashed in a way such that the zombie flew out the windsheild or back window depending on which characterthe player chose first.</p>

		<p>Leon and Claire only had moments to breathe when they saw a semi-truck darting through the street toward them. The truck driver from before had been zombified. Leon and Claire quickly exited the car ending up on opposite sides of a wreck. Vowing to meet each other at the Police Station as soon as possible.</p>
