		<p>Two months after the Mansion Incident, The T-Virus from the Umbrella Laboratory was released into Racccoon City turning all living and dead creatures into grotesque monsters. The Raccoon Police Department even when joined by the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S) are unable to contain the threat and are swiftly overrun. Jill Valentine, a member of former S.T.A.R.S Alpha Team was gearing up to leave Raccoon City to join Chris and Barry in their journey to take down Umbrella. However, this outbreak hastened her departure to earlier than intended. Upon leaving her apartment, she would come face-to-face with the evils that lurk the Raccoon Streets, including a nigh-invulnerable monster specifically hunting all surviving S.T.A.R.S members.</p>
