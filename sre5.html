		<p>Eleven years have passed since the incident on Rockfort Island and six years since the fall of Umbrella. Chris Redfield has joined in the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (B.S.A.A) for short. It is an international counter terrorism organization based around dealing with large scale bioterrorism threats. Redfield has taken part in a mission with the West African division for an unknown reason. However, this mission would lead him to more than what he was expecting.</p>
