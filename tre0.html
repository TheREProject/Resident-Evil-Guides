		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather limited. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.
			</p> 
			<p>- Furthermore, check the bodies! Two or three times should do. Some of them may posses extra ammo, key items, or may be playing dead which could come back to (pun intended) bite you later on. In this game, auto aim can be of great assistance to know if an enemy is around but out of sight.</p>

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>This game was once a GameCube exclusive until 2016.</li>
		<li>Unlike the RE1 remake, zombies do not become crimson heads if not decapitated or burned.</li>
		<li>When you get to the cable car, ensure that Billy is not carrying any important weapons. Otherwise, I hope you have a recent save to use. </li>
		<li>The grenade launcher's flame rounds have a chance of burning a zombie clean. However, flame rounds are far more rare to balance this out.</li>
		<li>There are some key differences between Billy and Rebecca that you must know.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Rebecca has the worst constitution of any character in the classic era of the series. It is recommended to use Billy in most combat situations as he can take far more damage.</li>
				<li>Futhermore, leave the heavy weapons to Billy. Rebecca is unable to handle heavy weapon recoil like Billy.</li>
				<li>Likewise, Billy is the only person in the series who CANNOT mix herbs. Silly isn't it?</li>
				<li>Only Billy can push certain objects while only Rebecca can use the hookshot.</li>
				<li>Billy's persoanl item is a lighter while Rebecca's is a chemsitry mixiing set.</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Originally, this game was going to be released on the Nintendo 64. </li>
		<li>Alternate outfits are included. The GameCube version required accessing the train's closet. However, the HD remaster allows changing clothes at anytime in the inventory screen. You must swap the character's personal item with the clothe's bag in the inventory.</li>
		<li>Most strong enemies are still weak to acid rounds. </li>
		<li>With the exception of the Infinite Rocket Launcher and submachine gun, bonuses and special weapons are obtained through the Leech Hunter minigame instead of the main game. Rewards are rank based and special weapons can be collected in the room next to the train's very first save room if not in Rebecca's inventory. Leech Hunter has 100 leech charms to collect. There are 50 for both characters respectively.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>E rank: Collect < 30 Leech Charms.</li>
				<p><b>Reward:</b> Sub-machine gun. Ammo can be picked up at certain places in the game.</p>
				<li>D rank: Collect at least 30 charms but no more than 59.</li>
				<p> <b>Reward:</b> Rewards from all preceeding ranks along with unlimited Handgun ammo.</p>
				<li>C rank: Collect at least 60 charms but no more than 89. </li>
				<p><b>Reward:</b> Rewards from all preceeding ranks along with unlimited Hunting Gun ammo.</p>
				<li>B rank: Collect at least 90 charms but no more than 100.</li>
				<p> <b>Reward:</b> Rewards from all preceeding ranks along with Magnum Revolver.</p>
				<li>A rank: Collect all 100 charms.</li>
				<p><b>Reward:</b> Rewards from all preceeding ranks along with an unlimited molotov cocktail, and finally, unlimited ammo for all weapons.</p>
		
			<li>The Infinite Rocket Launcher can be obtained by receiving an S-rank (completing the main game in under three hours and thirty minutes.) The sub-machine gun can be obtained with at least an A rank (complete the game in under five hours). You must play on at least Normal dificulty to receive any rank.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You can skip the first leech zombie fight by running back down the stairs to Billy.</li>
