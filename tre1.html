		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.
			</p> 
			<p>- Furthermore, check the bodies! Two or three times should do. Some of them may posses extra ammo, key items, or may be playing dead which could come back to (pun intended) bite you later on.

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>While their destinations are all the same, Chris and Jill have key differences that affect their respective journeys. Jill is considered the easier of the two for first time players.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Barry is Jill's support character while Rebecca is Chris'. Barry can assist Jill in ways that allow her to skip events that Chris cannot. Rebecca a certain times can Chris heal Chris without needing to obtain herbs or sprays.</li>
				<li>Chris has six inventory spaces while Jill has eight. This affects how the player utilizes item management for each character</li>
				<li>Chris runs faster and has more health. This negates the need to heal as often as Jill.</li>
				<li>Jill obtains a lockpick while Chris does not. The latter must obtain small keys to unlock simple locks.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>When playing the game, there are multiple endings. For Jill, her endings include herself, Chris, and Barry, herself and Chris, or herself and Barry. The same is applied for Chris except instead of Barry, it is Rebecca.</li>
		<li>Certain enemies have a weakness to a specific grenade shell from the grenade launcher. There is dialogue in-game that will hint which ones posses a weakness.</li>
		<li>The V-Jolt room PIN is randomized each playthrough. However, it is still easy enough to be brute forced once you figure out the pattern.</li>
		<li>None of the endings are canon in this game. The true ending is confirmed through the game's many sequels.</li>
		<li>Special Weapons can be unlocked by completing the game in a certain time limit</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Infinite Rocket Launcher: Complete the game in under two hours.</li>
			<li>Infinite Machine Pistol: Complete the game in under three hours.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

		<h1>Glitches/Cheats</h1>
		<p>This game contains a number of glitches and exploits discovered by speedrunners over the years.</p>
	</div>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li>By knfing a zombie and immediately entering the inventory screen and closing, you can then run past them without getting grabbed.</li>
			<li>On the original PSX (Playstation 1) version, it is possible to obtain a key item very early. Your combat knife is required.</li>
			<li>It is possible to skip the cutscene involving Jill finding Richard. However, ths will result in his immediate death.</li>
		</ul>
