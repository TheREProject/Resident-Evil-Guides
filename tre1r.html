		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather limited. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.
			</p> 
			<p>- Furthermore, check the bodies! Two or three times should do. Some of them may posses extra ammo, key items, or may be playing dead which could come back to (pun intended) bite you later on. In this game, auto aim can be of great assistance to know if an enemy is around but out of sight. Additionally, a "dead" zombie will eventually reanimate into a crimson head if it is not burned in time.</p>
	</div>
	
	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>This game was once a GameCube exclusive until 2015.</li>
		<li>The game does not warn you about this until it is too late. It is recommended to have at least three separate save game slots. One for Chris, one for Jill, and one for both. The third of these slots will unlock "One Dangerous Zombie" Mode. A Crimson Head version of Forest will be lurking around certain areas of the mansion with several bombs attached to him. Attacking him results in a game over. This cannot be disabled once active which is why the other two slots are present.  </li>
		<li> There are also two other game modes, Real Survivor and Invisible Enemy. The former sets the difficulty to Hard, Auto aim is disabled, and Items Boxes are NOT linked. Forgot that one key item in another part of the map? Better go there and get it. </li>
		<li>Invisible Enemy Mode is exactly what it sounds like. At least you can still hear them, and mirror reflections show them too. Now you know they're not vampires! </li>
		<li>While the choices have been cut, Barry's and Rebecca's survival are still dependent on actions you take in-game.</li>
		<li>The more powerful and higher capacity Assault shotgun can be obtained by giving Richard the serum. He will live long enough to save Chris/Jill. As Chris the gun will be at the bottom of the aqua ring after draining the water. As Jill you MUST stay and defeat Yawn the Snake. Leaving the room once Richard arrives will prevent you from getting the gun.</li>
		<li>Barry's Magnum can also be obtained by not giving him his gun back to fight Lisa Trevor. It is powerful enough to take down the tyrant in one blow.</li>
		<li>Zombies are no longer defeated through normal means. They must be burned, decapitated, or dismembered to avoid mutating into the stronger Crimson Heads.</li>
		<li>You can save kerosene by stacking two dead zombies on one another.</li>
		<li>The grenade launcher's flame rounds have a chance of burning a zombie clean. However, flame rounds are far more rare to balance this out.</li>
		<li>There are still some key differences that Chirs and Jill have that can change your gameplay experience.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Chris still runs faster and has more health. It is rumored that he also has a higher chance of scoring headshots.</li>
				<li>Chris still has six inventory slots compared to Jill's eight.</li>
				<li>Jill still gets her trusty lockpick in her personal space, but Chris now has his lighter in his personal space.</li>
				<li>Chris still needs to use small keys to unlock simple locks. But his inclusion of the lighter means he can light fire sensitive areas without losing a space, and he only needs to carry a kerosene tank to burn zombies.
				<li>Jill's exclusive self defense weapon only stuns enemies. Chris' exclusive weapon guarantees kills.</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>The developers love throwing shade at players of the original. For example, the L-shaped corridor in the 1F East section will feature a window glass slightly breaking as if the dogs will burst through. They never will during your first run through, and it will stay that way as long as you don't re-enter the room through the door leading to the shotgun room hallway. You may re-enter the corridor through the other door. </li>
		<li>Like the original, alternate outfits can be unlocked for Chris and Jill. The GameCube version required a closet key to access them. However, the HD remaster provides them both with the key and at the character selection screen.</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Chris:</b> Casual Outfit, Resident Evil Code: Veronica Outfit, and B.S.A.A Outfit (HD remaster onward) </li>
				<li><b>Jill:</b> Army Outfit, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Outfit, and B.S.A.A Outfit (HD remaster onward) </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Most strong enemies are still weak to acid rounds. </li>
		<li>In this game, sometimes it's better to let a zombie chew your ankles. The player will stomp on their head saving you the kerosene.</li>
		<li>There are other special weapons that can be obtained.</li>
		<li>You can obtain the knife only run trophy on any difficulty.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Infinite Samurai Edge: Complete the game in under five hours on Normal/Hard. This gun fires in three quick rounds and is said to increase headshot chance.</li>
				<li>Infinite Rocket Launcher: Complete the game in under three hours on Normal/Hard. Fun fact, despite being different from Brad's Rocket Launcher, it will still kill the tyrant in one shot.</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<div class="tiptitle">
		<h1>Glitches/Cheats</h1>
	</div>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li>The most popular glitch in this game is the Grenade Launcher Glitch. It greatly increases the number of rounds for a player. I recommend doing this with the flame rounds because that means free zombie burns. Unfotunatly, it is only available on the North American GameCube Edition. Check it out here (YouTube) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I9l0Kzy7_s">Link</a> </li>
			<li>You can quickly go up and down stairs by repeatedly tapping the run button while going up/down. (Original controls only) Doing this with the alternate controls is possible. But it requires more patience.</li>

		<p>This game contains a number of outcomes that are determined by your choices.</p>
