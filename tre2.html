		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.
			</p> 
			<p>- Furthermore, check the bodies! Two or three times should do. Some of them may posses extra ammo, key items, or may be playing dead which could come back to (pun intended) bite you later on.

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>In order to play the other character's B scenario, you must complete the other character's A scenario. These together form two whole stories with their own differences.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Leon B is unlocked by completing Claire A.</li>
				<li>Claire B is unlocked by completing Leon A.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>This time, both characters carry a personal item and the same inventory space. CLaire carries a lockpick while Leon carries a lighter. The lighter goes a longer way this time around compared to he lockpick.</li>
		<li>Due to the nature of the game, certain actions taken during the A scenario will affect the B scenario. To name a few.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If you don't kill a certain zombie in the police station during the A scenario, he will show up in the B scenario.</li>
				<li>If you take either the sub-machine gun or side pack in the police station, it will not be present in the B-scenario.</li>
				<li>If you use the cord on the windows in the A-scenario, the cord trips the circuit in the B scenario.</li>
				<li>If a certain boss is not kill by the A character, it will return in the B scenario.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Like the previous game, Special Weapons can be unlocked by completing the game with a certain rank. This rank is letter based with time of completion being one of its factors. Using these wepons at any point in time will drop your rank to a B even if the conditions for an A rank are met.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Infinite Rocket Launcher: Complete the A scenario with an A or B rank in under two hours and thirty minutes AND without saving.</li>
				<li>Infinite Gattling Gun: Complete the B scenario with an A or B rank in under two hours and thirty minutes.</li>
				<li>Infinite Sub-Machine Gun: Complete the A scenario with and A or B rank in under three hours.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>How to get each rank</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>A rank:</b> Complete the game in under two hours and thirty minutes WITHOUT using a first aid spray.</li>
				<li><b>B rank:</b> Complete the game in under three hours.</li>
				<li><b>C rank:</b> Complete the game within five to seven hours.</li>
				<li><b>D rank:</b> Complete the game in seven hours or greater.</li>
			</ul>

		<li>Search Wesker's desk fifty times to receive a secret image. </li>
		<li>On PC, the F3 button controls the game's mesh shader.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="tiptitle">
		<h1>Glitches/Cheats</h1>
		<p>This game contains a number of glitches and exploits discovered by speedrunners over the years.</p>
	</div>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li>There is an infinite ammo cheat that can be deactivated by entering this code again.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b>PC: </b> Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Aim. </li>
					<li><b>Nintendo 64: </b> At the load game screen, enter Up x4, Right x4, L, R, L, R, C-Right, C-Left. </li>
					<li><b>GameCube</b> Press and hold the aim button and then press Z.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><b>Free Reload:</b> If Leon finds a custom part for his handgun, shotgun, or magnum, he can gain a free reload by combining the weapon part with the weapon. It's a great way to save ammo.</li>
			<li>A Youtuber was affected by a glitch that rendered his Leon A scenario unwinnable. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk0_Q9GhZDY">here</a></li>
			<li><b>Brief Invincibility:</b> Mix herbs in the following order - Green + Blue then add a Red Herb to the mix.</li>
		</ul>
