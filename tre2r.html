		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- Note: Much like some of the past pre RE4 titles, only fight enemies if you have to. Even though ammo can be crafted, crafting supplies are still limited. Use your knife when you can. Especially on harder difficulties.
			</p>
			<p> Again, there is no shame in running. Mad running away skills will be helpful.</p>
	</div>
	
	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>There are extra weapons that can be unlocked/obtained in the game. Extra weapons can be purchased as DLC under "unlock all in-game rewards." But come on, don't you love a little challenge?</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>JMB Hp3:</b> Another handgun for Claire that can be obtained in the main game. It requires using the car key found in the RPD shooting range in the garage.</li>
				<li><b>Infinte durabilty combat knife:</b> A combat knife that won't ever break. Because this is a defense item, you must remember to pick it up after use or risk losing it for the rest of the game. </li>
				<li><b>Infinite Gatling Gun:</b> Complete a Claire run with an S+ rank on hardcore.</li>
				<li><b>Infinte Rocket Launcher:</b> Complete A Leon run with an S+ rank on hardcore.</li>
				<li><b>Samurai Edge:</b> A handgun with infintie ammo that can be obtained by completing any run with an S rank on normal or hardcore mode. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Speaking of ranks...</li>
		<ul>
				<li>To receive an S+ rank, you <b>CANNOT</b> use any special weapons except for the infinite combat knife. All others will drop your rank to an S at best.</li>
				<li>Furthermore, you can only save three times, avoid using first aid sprays, and avoid deaths/retries/continues.
				<li>All ranks below S+ are time based. For an S rank, you must finish a first scenario within Three hours and thirty minutes or a second scenario in under three hours.
			</ul>
		<li>The item box make their return.</li>
		<li>Normally, you don't need an ink ribbon to save. In hardcore mode, you do.</li>
		<li>In hardcore mode, there are no autosaves except at the beginning.</li>
		<li>A number of alternate outfits exist for Leon and Claire including their classic RE2 clothers. Although Claire's is rather off model.</li>	
		<li>This game also features an adaptive difficulty. Playing better increases enemy aggressivnes, health, and strength. The opposite occours when you are having trouble.</li>
		<li>You can knife a Licker to death as long as you stay behind it.</li>
		<li>If playing as Leon, it is recommended to kill the lickers and zombies near the club key room in the 1F West hallway BEFORE dealing with the helicopter. As Claire, clear the enemies in the hallway next to the weapons storage room. It will save you the trouble later on.</li>
		<li>It is best to kill Lickers as soon as you can. They are fast and can mess up a players run quickly.</li>
	</ul>

		<h1>Glitches/Cheats</h1>
	</div>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li>A YouTube going by the name of A+Start provided some glitches that worked on older version of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YvxIjnAPFc">check it out</a>.</li>
			<li>Knife damage is tied to framerate. The higher the better. PC players can use this to their advantage for knife runs.</li>
			<li>A speedrun tactic used to go up and down stairs faster involves running and using the aim button.</li>
			<li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYM5Mj0KlEw0F3neqHsZ26kW3Gx02psDw&si=mcUtXqciTJro2uiJ">Here</a> is another playlist of glitches that used to work with the clipping trick.</li>
