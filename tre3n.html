		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather limited. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.
			</p> 
			<p>- Furthermore, check the bodies! Two or three times should do. Some of them may posses extra ammo, key items, or may be playing dead which could come back to (pun intended) bite you later on. In this game, auto aim can be of great assistance to know if an enemy is around but out of sight. </p>

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Item and enemy placement for certain areas are randomized for each playthrough.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>For example, the weapon you receive in the S.T.A.R.S office locker roomn will be a magnum or grenade launcher. The unobtained weapon of the two will be obtained later on. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>The lockpick and lighter make yet another return. However, both are no longer personal items. They WILL take up inventory space. </li>
		<li>Originally, this game was meant to be a spinoff of RE2. The next title in the series was meant to be the real Resident Evil 3.</li>
		<li>This game takes place both before and after RE2. The first half begins on September 28th and ends on the night of September 29th. The second half begins and ends on October 1st. </li>
		<li>The Nemesis will be encountered in nine battles. Seven are optional while the other two are mandatory. On Hard Mode, defeating Nemesis during the optional battles provide supplies and munitions that will make the game easier. Assuming you defeat him in each optional encounter, these are the below rewards. </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Optional Encounter 1: Eagle Parts A.</li>
				<li>Optional Encounter 2: Eagle Parts B. Combined with the A parts, and you'll recieve a new, more accurate, and powerful handgun. It cannot use enhanced handgun ammo</li>
				<li>Optional Encounter 3: First aid box: Contains a box of three first aid sprays in one inventory slot. It is also refillable. </li>
				<li>Optional Encounter 4: M37 Parts A.</li>
				<li>Optional Encounter 5: M37 Parts B. Combined together, and you will receive a new stronger and faster (fire rate and reload speed) shotgun. However, it cannot use enhanced ammo. </li>
				<li>Optional Encounter 6: First aid box (again) </li>
				<li>Optional Encounter 7: Assault Rifle. All subsequent runs will reward you infinite ammo for one weapon only. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Remember, the rewards from these encounters are cumulative. That means your reward is based on how many times you defeated Nemesis in total. If you skip the first five encounters and defeat him in the final two, you would only receive the Eagle Parts A and B. </li>
		<li>Before encounter 7, you will be in control of Carlos. Defeating Nemesis as Carlos before going back to Jill will make her seventh encounter with the B.O.W easier due to take damage from the previoosu fight.</li>
		<li>Unlike the previous games, your rank and time of completion do not determine what special weapons you obtain. The side game "The Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal" is the new method. There are four rewards.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Infinite Assault Rifle</li>
				<li>Infinite Gattling Gun</li>
				<li>Infinite Rocket Launcher</li>
				<li>Infinite Ammo for all weapons: <b>Cannot be undone once purchased.</b></li>
			</ul>
