		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather limited. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>This game has greatly improved on the dodge mechanic compared to its predecessor. If a perfect dodge is executed, time will briefly slow down and have Jill auto aim toward enemy weak points when aiming.</li>
		<li>Most bonus weapons are unlocked in the shop using points. Points are acquired by completing the game's several tasks. You must complete all tasks to purchase all shop items.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>What you start with is up to you. However, the end goal is always the infinte rocket launcher.</li>
				<li>I would recommend the S.T.A.R.S combat manual first. It will make perfect dodges FAR easier. And, unless you're willing to put in a lot of work, this item will be REQUIRED to complete this game on Inferno Mode.</li>
				<li>After the manual, go for the crafting tool. More bullets for your buck or increased base stats. Take your pick!</li>
				<li>Then, go for the bolt cutters and lockpick if you want to access closed off areas earlier.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>One of the fastest way to farm points is to replay the hospital seige portion of Carlos' part over and over on the easiest difficulty. </li>	
		<li>This game takes place both before and after RE2. The first half begins on September 28th and ends on the night of September 29th. The second half begins and ends on October 1st. </li>
		<li>The number of Nemesis encounters in regular play are fewer than the original. He is also easier to defeat this time around. One grenade or explosive barrel will usually do the trick on normal difficulties.</li>
		<li>Imo, the drops aren't worth it once you get the stronger weapons.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Drop 1: Extended magazine.</li>
				<li>Drop 2: Handgun Moderator. It increases firepower and critical hit chance</li>
				<li>Drop 3: Shotgun shells. </li>
				<li>Drop 4: Flame Rounds.</li>

			</ul>

			<li>(YouTube) A user going by the name of "Louigh" found an easier way to defeat Nemesis on Inferno Mode<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJZcRqmoi6o"> LINK.</a></li>
			<li>There is a rare glitch where Nemesis can find Jill and be unable to attack her.</li>
