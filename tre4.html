		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- Note: Ammo is more plentiful than past titles. But it is recommended if not encouraged to use your knife and melee attacks on downed enemies when possible. That way, you can save your ammo for larger crowds, stronger enemies, and bosses.
			</p> 

			<p>- An easy way to save ammo while facing a few enemies is a shot to the head or knee. This will stagger them and open them up to melee attacks. If the enemy is not dead, you can kniofe them until they get back up or die. Rinse and repeat for the former.
			</p> 
	</div>
	
	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Melee attacks spread. You can use this to your advantage when ganged up on and no time to switch to a crowd control weapon.</li>
		<li>This game has one of the most bottled plots of the main series, and very few past characters show up in this game. It is not required to know about previous titles to understand this story.</li>
		<li>Unlike past titles (sans RE0), there is no item box. However, key items and the knife now have their own exclusive spots.</li>
		<li>This game went through three development phases before becoming Resident evil 4.</li>
		<li>There are some key differences between Billy and Rebecca that you must know.</li>
		<li>Most enemies speak Spanish and will let you know when they're behind you "Detras de ti imbecil" is a common phrase said by the villagers. Others may laugh or say "Te cogi" instead.</li>
		<li>This game features an adaptive difficulty. Playing better increases enemy aggressivnes, health, and strength. THe opposite occours when you are having trouble. Professional Mode locks the adaptive setting to its highest level.</li>
		<li>Most Special weapons are unlocked by completing the game and then acumulating enough money to purchase them.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Infinite Rocket Launcher: Costs 1,000,000 PTAS</li>
				<li>Matila: Costs 70,000 PTAS. Honestly, it's nothing more than the upgraded handgun from RE2. Not only does it eat handgun ammo, it doesn't compare to other New Game+ weapons.</li>
				<li>P.R.L: 412: Requires completing the game on professional mode (PS2 onward.) It's pretty much an infinite Flash Grenade but as bursts and lasers. Uncharged, it functions as a flash grenade. It stuns enemies and instantly kills plagas and even some bosses. Fully charged, it will (Wii version onward) kill/break every enemy, breakable object, trap, animal, and most bosses in one shot. Believe it or not, this weapon is free!</li>
				<li>Handcannon: Complete the Mercenaries with all five characters on all FOUR stages with FIVE stars in each. The gun itself is free. However, upgrades are not. Once fully upgraded, it gains infinite ammo and becomes the second strongest weapon in the game.</li>
				<li>Chicago Typewriter: 1,000,000 PTAS. This weapon is an infinite ammo fully automatic powerhouse! Complete Assignment Ada in the GameCube version. From the PS2 onward, complete Separate Ways. Completing Assignment Ada on these ports will unlock it in Separate Ways.</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Alternate outfits are included. Leon and Ada can wear their respective RE2 outfits while Ashley gains a white pop star outfit. From the PS2 version onward, the trio gain a mafia outfit, and indescrutable suit of armor, and a spy outfit</li>	
		<li>Fun fact: With his Mafia Outfit, Leon's Chicago Typewriter model changes. The "reload" animation will also give you a nice surprise when attempting it multiple times.</li>
		<li>Ashley's armor makes her immune to all damage and enemy capture.</li>
		<li>There are some key differences between Billy and Rebecca that you must know.</li>
		<li>To save money, it is recommended you only use your upgrades on weapons you intend to keep.</li>
		<li>In chapter 1, you can grind some extra money by collecting chicken eggs and selling them to the merchant.</li>
		<li>Unlike past titles, there are no completion ranks. </li>

		<li>Eggs can be equipped and will not kill Ashley if she's hit by one.</li>
		<li>Be careful when shooting the lake at the end of chapter 1.</li>
		<li>Some bosses have some interesting weaknesses.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Mendez hates Incindiary Grenades.</li>
			<li>Sadler hates Hand Grenades.</li>
			<li>Verdugo does not do well with Liquid Nitrogen and a Rocket Launcher.</li>
			<li>Krauser takes more damage when using the knife on him.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>If you prefer non special weapons and raw power over anything else.</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Handgun:</b> Red9</li>
			<li><b>Shotgun:</b> Striker</li>
			<li><b>Sniper:</b> Rifle</li>
			<li><b>Magnum:</b> Broken Butterfly</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Glitches/Cheats</h1>
	</div>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li><b>Ditman glitch:</b> The famous Ditman glitch was discovered a long while back. To activate it, you must purcahse the striker. Open your inventory in the middle of Leon's aim animation and then exit. You will now run faster, and gain the opportunity to clip through certain areas (by extension skipping certain areas). The glitch will deactivate if you equip or fire the striker, take damage, or get a cutsene going. Learn more about the glitch (YouTube) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuc82MF92mA">here.</a> </li>
			<li>Boulder chases can be skipped by using a grenade on yourself at the right spot.</li>
			<li>Some enemies will NOT attack you from behind. Use this to your advantage.</li>
			<li>In chapter 4-1, you can shoot (or RPG) the four lights on the ceiling before entering the room.</li>
			<li>If you can clip through some areas. they will feature herbs, ammo, money, and Ada's shotgun. Equipping the latter will crash the game as Leon.</li>
			<li>In chapter 3-4 of the original GameCube release, Ashley can supplex an enemy.</li>	
			<li>In chapter 3-2 of the original GameCube release, There is a locked door where Leon can shoot the lock on the other side of the room. This allows him to skip the maze.</li>	
			<li>You can save ammo by purchasing capacity upgrades for the weapons you intend to keep. They come with free reloads!</li>	
			<li>If you fail to kill the goat cultist in chapter 3-2 on the balcony, jump to the first floor of the room and cut him off. This will save you trouble.</li>
			<li>Novistadors can't fly/climb through windows.</li>
			<li>During the battle of the ruins, you can jump down a ladder or through a windows to avoid Leon's reflex after Krauser throws a flash grenade.</li>
			<li>Completing a QTE during a reload animation completes it even though the reload animation never finishes.</li>
			<li>In chapter 5-4, if you walk through the jail cell corridor, you will not alert the Regenerator in the area. You can even walk right up to it.</li>
			<li>There is a glitch at the end of the game where Leon can abandon Ashley at the jetski dock.</li>
