		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- Note: Ammo is more plentiful than classic titles. But it is recommended if not encouraged to use your melee attacks when possible. That way, you can save your ammo for larger crowds, stronger enemies, and bosses.
			</p> 

			<p>- An easy way to save ammo while facing a few enemies is a shot to the head or knee. This will stagger them and open them up to melee attacks. If the enemy is not dead, you can knife them until they get back up or die. Rinse and repeat for the former.
			</p> 

			<p>- In this game, the most efficient way to kill a regular enemey is a shot to the kneee, getting behind them, and performing Chris or Sheva's one-hit kill move (Neck Snap and Throat Slit respecitvely.)

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Melee attacks spread. You can use this to your advantage when ganged up on and no time to switch to a crowd control weapon.</li>
		<li>While not required, it is recommended that one plays RE1 (Classic or Remake), RE3: Nemesis, RE Code: Veronica, and RE4 to better understand the plot.</li>
		<li>Much like RE4 and RE0, there is no item box. However, the end of each chapter or reloading a checkpoint will allow you to access an item-box like menu where you can store weapons, ammo, and health items. Key items and knife retain their own exclusive spots.</li>
		<li>Originally, Chris was going to be alone like Leon in RE4.</li>
		<li>If playing on Professinal Difficulty, please have a friend play along. The CPU is a terrible companion.</li>
		<li>This game also features an adaptive difficulty. Playing better increases enemy aggressivnes, health, and strength. The opposite occours when you are having trouble. Professional Mode locks the adaptive setting to its highest level.</li>
		<li>Most special weapons can be accessed without completing the game. But there are exceptions.</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Gattling Gun:</b> Chris' exclusive weapon. </li>
				<li><b>Longbow:</b> Sheva' exclusive weapon.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Alternate outfits are included. Chris has his S.T.A.R.S Uniform, Heavy Metal, and Safair look. Sheva gains a Little Red Riding Hood like outfit, a business outfit, and a "tribal" outfit.</li>	
		<li>Fun fact: You can taunt an opponent by pressing down on on of the joystick on console editions.</li>
		<li>Ashley's armor makes her immune to all damage and enemy capture.</li> 
		<li>Invincibility frames can usually include picking up items, healing, assisting your partner, melee attacks, and climbing over objects.</li> 
		<li>You can also reload via the inventory like past titles sans RE4.</li>

			<li><b>Infinite Money Glitch:</b> By duplicating rotten eggs and selling them, you can gain a lot of money depending on how early you acquire a rotten egg. Learn more about the glitch (YouTube) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4CYRIaHcSE">here.</a> </li>
			<li>(PC @ 60 fps) During the Urobouros fight in chapter 5, you can use six incindiary grenades or flame rounds to end the fight.</li>
