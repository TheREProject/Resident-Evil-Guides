		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- Note: Ammo is more plentiful than classic titles. But it is recommended if not encouraged to use your melee attacks when possible. That way, you can save your ammo for larger crowds, stronger enemies, and bosses.
			</p> 

			<p>- Melee is far easier this time around now that it is no longer tied to a specific action. Tap the meele button twice on an enemy to gain the potential for a melee finisher.

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Melee attacks spread. You can use this to your advantage when ganged up on and no time to switch to a crowd control weapon.</li>
		<li>Knowledge of past games is recommended before playing this game.</li>
		<li>Much like RE4 and RE0, there is no item box. And unlike 5, there is no greater storage.</li>
		<li>Unlike RE5, your CPU controlled partner character cannot be injured or killed through ordinary means. They also have unlimited ammo.</li>
		<li>This game also features an adaptive difficulty. Playing better increases enemy aggressivnes, health, and strength. The opposite occours when you are having trouble.</li>
		<li>There are no special weapons in this game regardless of completion.</li>
		<li>Alternate outfits are included. But they cannot be used outside of the Mercenaries.</li>	
		<li>Invincibility frames can usually include healing, assisting your partner, melee finishers, and climbing over certain objects.</li>
