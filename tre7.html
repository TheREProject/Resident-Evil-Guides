		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- Note: RE4 - RE6 spoiled us by having enemies drop ammo and healing items. Well, this game took this away and went back in time. Much like some of the past pre RE4 titles, only fight enemies if you have to. 
			</p> 
	</div>
	
	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Unlike RE6, there are extra weapons that can be unlocked/obtained in the game.</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>M19:</b> Another handgun that can be obtained in the maingame. Picking up repair parts and combining it with the broken handgun will create this weapon. It is slightly stronger and has a higher headshot chance but has less capacity.</li>
				<li><b>M21:</b> Another shotgun that can be obtained in the maingame. Picking up repair parts and combining it with the broken shotgun will create this weapon. It's like the hunting gun in RE0 holding only two shells but more firepower. </li>
				<li><b>Circular Saw:</b> This is your TRUE go-to melee weapon. It shreds through most base enemies as well as Stalker Jack. All you need to do is complete the game within 4 hours to unlock it.</li>
				<li><b>Albert-01R:</b> Complete the game once to obtain this weapon. It uses handgun bullets with firepower akin to magnums. Unfortunately, it can only be fired three times before reloading. </li>
				<li><b>MPM:</b> Another handgun that can be obtained late in the game. Other than the bullets, it's not worth taking. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Knowledge of past games is not required to understand the plot. This is because almost none of the past characters and their plot points make a return or are referenced outside of Chris Redfeild, Clive O' Brian, and Alyssa Ashcroft. And the latter two are from spinoff titles.</li>
		<li>The item box makes its return.</li>
		<li>Typewriters do not make a return. Instead, cassettes are used in its place. They do not require tapes. However, they do on madhouse mode</li>
		<li>This game also features an adaptive difficulty. Playing better increases enemy aggressivnes, health, and strength. The opposite occours when you are having trouble.</li>
		<li>There are no alternate outfits.</li>
		<li>Ethan has a running gag where his face is not be seen.</li>
