		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
			<p>- This tip applies to all survival horror games. Knowing when to fight and when to run is key. Resources are plentiful for those who search. But they are still rather limited. If you're not careful, you'll be stuck with no healing items, no ammo, and a strong enemy around the corner waiting to kill you.
			</p> 
			<p>- Furthermore, check the bodies! Two or three times should do. Some of them may posses extra ammo, key items, or may be playing dead which could come back to (pun intended) bite you later on. In this game, auto aim can be of great assistance to know if an enemy is around but out of sight. </p>

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Contrary to popular belief, this game is one of the most generous games of the classic era regarding ammo. Thanks to this and/or proper use of the knife, it is possible to finish the game with a copious amount of ammo and weapons left over.</li>
		<li>The Sniper Rifle was originally going to be reloadable.</li>
		<li>The Metal detection box and item boxes are NOT connected! Be sure to take all important items (weapons, ammo, the Fire Extinguisher) from the former and place them in the latter A.S.A.P!</li>
		<li>While Leon plays a role in this game without physically appearing, he was originally going to be in Steve's place. THe latter's appearance changed from the previous version of Code Veronica to avoid him looking too much like Leonardo DiCaprio.</li>
		<li>The infinite rocket launcher is the only infinite weapon rewarded for the main game. You must finish it with an A-rank. </li>
			<ul>
				<li> An A-rank requires finishing the game within four hours and thirty minutes WITHOUT saving (You may only save at the end of part one), retrying from a checkpoint, or using a First Aid Spray.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>The lockpick and lighter make yet another return. However, they have returned to being personal items that don't take up inventory space.</li>
		<li>This game was originally going to be the real Resident Evil 3.</li>
		<li>Rockfort Island in in the Southern Hemisphere. </li>
		<li>Giving Rodridgo the Hemostatic Medicine is required to get the submachine guns. </li>
		<li>One of the puzzle solutions lies within the game's title. </li>
		<li>It is possible to get grabbed by a zombie without taking damage. You must wiggle the joystick immediately upon getting grabbed. If successful, your character will push the zombie without the bite animation. </li>
		<li>When using dual weild weapons, you can change targeting to multiple enemies or one enemy by pressing the change target button while aiming. </li>
		<li>The Inventory Screen can be access using the R3 button on the PS3 version. </li>
		<li>The Lighter repels bats. </li>
		<li>After switching back to Claire from Chris. Do NOT give her any of the powerful weapons and ammo longer than a breif moment. You will regret it. A handgun and some handgun bullets should suffice. </li>
		<li>The Gulp Worm at the begining of the game can be skipped. Just know that it will always be pursuing you in the area during your stay. </li>
		<li>Most strong enemies are still weak to acid rounds. </li>
		<li>During Steve's segment, the number of zombies he kills will determine which set of dialogue is used after. </li>
	</ul>

		<h1>Glitches/Cheats</h1>
	</div>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li>The most popular glitch in this game is the infinite Herb Glitch parented by the manual glitch. By following the correct steps, you can have your very own infinite healing item (Yes even the RGB herb mix.) It's great for A-rank runs. Check it out here (YouTube) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I9l0Kzy7_s">Link</a> </li>
			<li>You can duplicate you sub machine guns! (YouTube) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1B0v4c70QY">Check it out!</a> </li>
			<li>You can avoid the zombie crashing through the windows in the Eagle Medal Room. Before picking up the medal, make sure you walk through the metal detector with a metalic item. Even if you foget to bring one, you can pick up the flame rounds, the rare anti-B.O.W round, or the first aid spray and use either one. Don't forget to take it out of the security box if you want it later!</li>
			<li>The GameCube Edition supposedly allows you to pause the gameclosk by opening the disc tray. </li>
