	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Combat Knife</p>
		<p>Your go-to melee weapon. Like all the previous entries (bar Code: Veronica), unless you're a very skilled player, this weapon is practically useless and meant to be used as a last resort.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\beckyhg.png" alt="Beretta">
		<p class="name">Rebecca's Handgun</p>
		<p>A 9mm Handgun used by Rebecca. Like most handguns, it's best used on weaker enemies. It is recommended to leave drop it the moment you can access Billy's gun. It can be upgraded to increase fire rate and critical hits. However, as there is only one custom part, it is best used on the other handgun.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\billyhg.png" alt="Handgun">
		<p class="name">Billy's Handgun</p>
		<p>Billy's 9mm handgun. At base, it is better then Rebecca's with higher firepower and critical hit chance. Use it as soon as possible, and save the custom parts for it.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\huntinggun.png" alt="Hunting">
		<p class="name">Hunting Gun</p>
		<p>The first obtainable shotgun in the game. It boasts more firepower than the shotgun. But it only hold two bullets before you must reload.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\shotty.png" alt="Shotgun">
		<p class="name">Pump Action Shotgun</p>
		<p>The second obtainable shotgun in the game. It is weaker than the hunting gun. But it offers a higher capacity (7 compared to 2). Best used on stronger enemies or headshotting zombies. Like RE1 remake, headshots are no longer guaranteed. But their chances are still greater than with the handgun.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\magnum.png" alt="Magnum">
		<p class="name">Magnum</p>
		<p>A magnum obtained later in the game. It is best used on stronger enemies and bosses. Unfortunately, ammo is very limited compared to shotgun and handgun ammo. So use sparingly.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\grenade.png" alt="GL">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher </p>
		<p>A versatile weapon that can be obtained in the game. Ammo types can vary by explosive, flame, and acid shells. Ammo is not as limited as the magnum. However, it is still rather rare. It is great to use as an alternate weapon when shotgun ammo is low.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re0weapons\molotov.png" alt="MC">
		<p class="name">Molotov Cocktail</p>
		<p>The worst weapon in the game. Unfortunately, it will be required to use against a certain flammable enemy.</p>
	</div>
