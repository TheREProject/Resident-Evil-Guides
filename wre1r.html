	</div>

	<div class="summary">
		<p>Note: This remake expands on the weapons arsenal by including self defense weapons. These cannot be used for normal combat as they are meant to be used to save your character from taking damage.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Combat Knife</p>
		<p>Your go-to melee weapon. Unless you're a very skilled player, this weapon is practically useless and barring one situation, it's meant to be used as a last resort.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\handgun.png" alt="Beretta">
		<p class="name">Handgun</p>
		<p>A 9mm Handgun used by both Chris and Jill. Best used on weaker enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\shotgun.png" alt="Shotgun">
		<p class="name">Pump Action Shotgun</p>
		<p>A shotgun used by both Chris and Jill. Best used on stronger enemies or headshotting zombies. Unlike the previous version, headshots are no longer guaranteed. But their chances are still greater than with the handgun.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\maggy.png" alt="Magnum">
		<p class="name">Magnum</p>
		<p>A magnum used by both Chris and Jill. Best used on stronger enemies and bosses. Unfortunately, ammo is very limited compared to shotgun and handgun ammo. So use sparingly.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\grenade.png" alt="GL">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher </p>
		<p>A weapon used by Jill only. Ammo types can vary by explosive, flame, and acid shells. Ammo is not as limited as the magnum. However, it is still rather rare. It is great to use as an alternate weapon when shotgun ammo is low.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\flame.png" alt="Flamethrower">
		<p class="name">Flamethrower</p>
		<p>A weapon used by Chris only. As it can only be used in specific locations, it is best to use this weapon before switching back to your permanent weapons.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\flame.png" alt="Flamethrower">
		<p class="name">Flamethrower</p>
		<p>A weapon used by Chris only. As it can only be used in specific locations, it is best to use this weapon before switching back to your permanent weapons.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\dagger.png" alt="Dagger">
		<p class="name">Dagger</p>
		<p>A self defense weapon used by Chris and Jill. Either characetr will stab enemies who have grabbed or tackled them from the front. If the player executes a headshot after stabbing an enemy, the dagger can be retrieved for reuse.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\battery.png" alt="battery">
		<p class="name">Stun Battery</p>
		<p>A self defense weapon used by Jill only. It stuns enemies who have grabbed or tackled Jill from the front with an electric shock to the torso.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\flash.png" alt="battery">
		<p class="name">Flash Grenade</p>
		<p>A self defense weapon used by Chris only. When grabbed or tackled from the front, Chris will shove a live grenade into the enemy's mouth killing them in seconds. From my experience, this is the best self defense weapons in the game. Who could turn down guaranteed headshots?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re1rweapons\sdgun.png" alt="sd gun">
		<p class="name">Self Defense Gun</p>
		<p>Another obtainable weapon in the game. It is said to pack more power than the magnum. But it only has one shot. So save it for a boss or strong enemy.</p>
	</div>
