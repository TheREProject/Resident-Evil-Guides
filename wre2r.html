	<div class="summary">
		<p>Note: Much like the original RE2, Claire and Leon have their own exclusive weapons. However, most of them can now be upgraded with various weapon parts that can be found within the game.</p>
		<p>Ammo can also be crafted with the use of gunpowder. The high grade version is yellow for Leon and White for Claire.</p>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li>Gunpowder combined with another of itself or creates <b>handgun bullets</b></li>
			<li>Gunpowder combined with its high grade version creates <b>shotgun shells</b> for Leon and <b>acid rounds</b> for Claire</li>
			<li>High Grade Gunpowder combined with another of itself creates <b>Magnum bullets</b> for Leon and <b>sub machine gun bullets</b> for Claire.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Combining the large version of regular gunpowder will yield more ammo than with its smaller version.</p>

		<p>Defense items make a return from the RE1 remake. Unlike the previous title, these weapons can be used freely.</p>
		<ul class="trivia">
			<li><b>Combat Knife:</b> This is the only knife avaialble to the player. Even as a defense item only, it is still your go-to melee weapon when you've got it. Unfortunately, it has a durability limit. Too many hits, and it will break.</li>
			<li><b>Flash Grenade:</b> Stuns and blinds enemies.</li>
			<li><b>Hand Grenade:</b> Like past titles, it is a thrown explosive weapon. Great to use on crowds or tough opponents.</li>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\matilda.png" alt="matilda">
		<p class="name"> Matilda</p>
		<p>Leon's starting handgun. It can be upgraded to reduce recoil, increase accuracy and capacity, and even a returning upgrade in the form of three burst shots. Use this on zombies and other weaker enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\w-870.png" alt="w-870">
		<p class="name">W-870</p>
		<p>Leon's trusty shotgun obtainable (sorta) early in the game. It can be upgraded to increase capacity, reload rate, firing speed, and reduce spread. It's great for headshotting zombies! However, a perfect headshot is still not 100% guaranteed.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\lh.png" alt="magnum">
		<p class="name"> Lightning Hawk</p>
		<p> Leon's magnum. It can be upgraded to improve accuracy and firepower. As always, ammo is limited unless you plan on crafting only magnum ammo. Still, save it for tough enemies and bosses.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\flame.png" alt="FT">
		<p class="name">Flamethrower</p>
		<p>It does exactly what it says it does. It can also be upgraded to use less ammo per "shot." And you will want to keep this weapon for later. Trust me on that.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\m19.png" alt="m19">
		<p class="name">M19</p>
		<p>An optional handgun for Leon in his 2md run. While stronger than the matilda, it lacks the equivalent capacity.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\sls60.png" alt="sls">
		<p class="name">SLS 60</p>
		<p>Claire's starting handgun. It can be upgraded to increase reload speed and fire devastatingly powerful shots akin to a magnum. You kow the drill now.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\gm79.png" alt="grenade launcher">
		<p class="name">GM 79</p>
		<p>Claire's obtainable grenade launcher. It only uses flame and acid rounds. Imo, flame rounds carry more mileage than the acid rounds. So, guard those rounds with your life! Also, this weapon can be upgraded to improve shots and accuracy.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\mq11.png" alt="subby">
		<p class="name">MQ 11</p>
		<p>Claire's automatic weapon. It can be upgraded to include a stock as well as a silencer which makes for great stealth maneuvers around certain enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\sparky.png" alt="sparkshot">
		<p class="name">Sparkshot</p>
		<p>An electrifyingly great weapon for Claire. Aim, fire, keep aiming, big shock! Can be upgraded to improve fire rate. Great against certain bosses and tough opponents.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re2rweapons\army.png" alt="qda">
		<p class="name">Quickdraw Army</p>
		<p>Claire's optional handgun in her second run. It fire shix rapid shots in one go and little recoil. Unfortunately, it's still a fairly slow weapon. Best if you want to sacrifice speed for firepower.</p>
