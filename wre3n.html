	<div class="summary">
		<p>In this game, we are introduced the concept of ammo crafting. You can craft ammo for every weapon in your possession except the Mine Thrower, Grenade Rounds, and special weapons (more on those in the Trivia section).</p>
	</div>

	<ul class="trivia">
		<li>Gunpowder A creates handgun bullets</li>
		<li>Gunpowder B creates shotgun bullets</li>
		<li>Gunpowder C is created by combining A and B. This powder type creates magnum bullets.</li>
		<p>After combining enough of gunpowder A or B with the Crafting tool, you can craft enhanced ammo. This ammo will pack more firepower requiring less bullets to take down enemies.</p>

		<br>
		<p>By combining one of the three powders with Grenade Rounds, you'll get the following.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Combining A will give you flame rounds.</li>
			<li>Combining B gives you acid rounds.</li>
			<li>Combining C gives you freeze rounds.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3nweapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Knife</p>
		<p>Once again, this will be your go-to melee weapon. And just like the previous entries, unless you're a very skilled (or desperate) player, this weapon is practically useless.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3nweapons\handgun.png" alt="handgun">
		<p class="name">Handgun</p>
		<p>A 9mm Handgun used by Jill. Custom made and dubbed "Samurai Edge." It has a fifteen clip capacity. Best used on weaker or stunned enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3nweapons\shotgun.png" alt="shotgun">
		<p class="name">Shotgun</p>
		<p>A shotgun used by Jill. Like all shotguns before, it is best used on stronger enemies, headshotting zombies, or downing crowds of enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3nweapons\grenade.png" alt="Grenade Launcher">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher</p>
		<p>A versatile weapon used by Jill. Unlike the previous entries, this ammo not only includes grenade, acid, and flame rounds. It also features Freeze Rounds. They will be very usefull against the Nemesis in all your battles. Yes, battles. As in more than one fight.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3nweapons\maggy.png" alt="Magnum">
		<p class="name">Magnum</p>
		<p>A high grade handgun used by Jill. Like the previous entry, finding ammo is more scarce than shotgun ammo. However, thanks to ammo crafting, this is (sort of) mitigated.</p>		
	</div>


	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3nweapons\mine.png" alt="MineT">
		<p class="name">Minethrower</p>
		<p>Exactly what the name says. Don't stand too close. Or you'll get caught in the blast!</p>
	</div>
