	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3rweapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Knife</p>
		<p>Once again, this will be your go-to melee weapon. Unlike RE2 Remake, it won't break. That means it's still great for knifing zombies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3rweapons\g19.png" alt="handgun">
		<p class="name">G19</p>
		<p>A 9mm Handgun that's obtained early in the game. It can be upgrade to improve focus and critical hit chance.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3rweapons\m3.png" alt="shotgun">
		<p class="name">M3</p>
		<p>A shotgun used by Jill. Like all shotguns before, it is best used on stronger enemies, headshotting zombies, or downing crowds of enemies. Upgrades include accuracy, fire rate, and reload rate.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3rweapons\grenade.png" alt="Grenade Launcher">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher</p>
		<p>A versatile weapon used by Jill. Unlike the previous entries, ammo not only includes grenade, acid, and flame rounds. It also features mine rounds. The latter will have its use in one of the boss battles. So don't neglect them.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3rweapons\maggy.png" alt="Magnum">
		<p class="name">Lightning Hawk</p>
		<p>A high grade magnum used by Jill and missable if you don't do some exploring. Like the previous entry, finding ammo is more scarce than shotgun ammo. However, thanks to ammo crafting, this is (sort of) mitigated. Again, use it on stronger enemies or bosses only.</p>		
	</div>


	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re3rweapons\g18.png" alt="G18">
		<p class="name">G18 Burst</p>
		<p>A handgun that can be obtained later in the game. It functions much like Leon's Matilda in RE2 and its remake.</p>
	</div>
