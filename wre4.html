	</div>

	<div class="summary">
		<p>Note: Due to the sheet number of weapons and variety, I will have this ordered differently. Also, most weapons are not longer obtained through the game. They are purchased at the weapons shop via The Merchant. Most weapons can also be upgraded through the shop to increase firepower, reload speed, capacity, and firing speed in some cases. Upon maximizing upgrades, the player can then purchase an exclusive upgrade that further increases the weapon's most notable capability.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Combat Knife</p>
		<p>Your go-to melee weapon. And VERY much unlike past titles sans Code: Veronica, the knife is an absolute Godsend. The devlopers have turned this weapon from a last resport weapons to a primary resort weapon. There are multiple players who have completed this game using only the knife. Only sparingly wasa gun ever used.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\handgun.png" alt="Handgun">
		<p class="name"> Handgun</p>
		<p>Leon's starting 9mm Handgun. While this handgun is typically not good for bosses, it is great at taking point for opening enemies to melee take downs. With its exclusive upgrade,  the chance of scoring a perfect headshot increases five fold!</p>
	</div>


		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\shotty.png" alt="Shotgun">
		<p class="name">Shotgun</p>
		<p>One of the few weapons that can be obtained for free. It's great for downing large crowds, taking out multiple enemies' heads, or taking down stubborn enemies. With its exclusive upgrade, its increased firepower will remain static at all ranges.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\rifle.png" alt="Rifle">
		<p class="name">Rifle</p>
		<p>A basic sniper rifle. Its zoom can be increased with a scope that can be purchased by at the shop. Due to its low rate of fire and reload requirements after each shot, it's recommended to use this at a very long range. But it makes up for this by having great penetrating power. Its exclusive upgrade pushes the weapons firepower into (non-exclusive) magnum territory.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\tmp.png" alt="tmp">
		<p class="name">TMP</p>
		<p>An automatic machine gun that can be upgraded to include a stock for steadier aiming. It is low in firepower. But it makes up for this by including a large capacity...while also lacking in ammo drops. Yeah, it's good for taking out crowds too. But it's not exactly my cup of tea. Once you get the exclusive, it becomes more worthwhile at least.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\punisher.png" alt="punisher">
		<p class="name">Punisher</p>
		<p>Another free weapon provided to the player if they shoot at least ten blue medalions scattered around the farm and church area of the game. If all fifteen medalions are shot, a firepower upgrade will be included. While it boasts the ability to pierce two enemies in one shot, it is the second weakest gun (behind the TMP) even when fully upgraded. Its exclusive upgrade allows you to pierce through five enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\hgrenade.png" alt="Hand Grenade">
		<p class="name">Hand Grenade </p>
		<p>A simple throwable hand explosive. Just don't stand too close to a live one!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\igrenade.png" alt="Flame Grenade">
		<p class="name">Incindiary Grenade </p>
		<p>A throwable hand grenade that bursts into flames. The flame remains active for a few seconds allowing for continuous damage.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\fgrenade.png" alt="Flash Grenade">
		<p class="name">Flash Grenade </p>
		<p>A hand grenade that explodes into ultra UV lightining. Great for blinding most base enemies and outright killing their *stronger* forms.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\red9.png" alt="Red9">
		<p class="name">Red9</p>
		<p>Despite appearing early in the game, this is the most powerful handgun in the game. It can be used as a secondary boss killing weapon if magnum and shotgun ammo are too low. Like the TMP, it can be upgraded with a stock to stabilize aiming and recoil.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\rpg.png" alt="RPG">
		<p class="name">Rocket Launcher</p>
		<p>A single use weapon that can be purchased from the merchant. Great for one-shotting most bosses if you have the cash.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\blacktail.png" alt="bt">
		<p class="name">Blacktail</p>
		<p>Another handgun purchasable at the shop. It is the most balanced of handguns as it is powerful (But not as powerful as the red9), and it boasts a wonderful capacity and fire rate while taking up less space than the Re9 with and without its stock.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\riotgun.png" alt="Riot Gun">
		<p class="name">Riot Gun</p>
		<p>The second shotgun Leon can purchase. It is also the second most powerful but great at knocking down enemies from a greater distance.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\semirifle.png" alt="srifle">
		<p class="name">Semi-auto Rifle</p>
		<p>A Semi-Auto Rifle that can be purchased. While not packing as much power as the other rifle, its lack of turning, fire rate (excusive upgrade), and increased capacity more than make up for it.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\mines.png" alt="mt">
		<p class="name">Mine Thrower</p>
		<p>A weapons that tosses mines. Ammo is rare (less rare if you have fewer weapons) and like all explosive weapons, will damage you if your target gets too close. It's more trouble than it's worth even after the exclusive upgrade. It adds homing capabilities.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\butterfly.png" alt="bb">
		<p class="name">Broken Butterfly</p>
		<p>Surprisingly a free to obtain weapon given its nature. This is no doubt a boss or strong enemy weapon. But with its exclusive upgrade, it becomes the THIRD strongest gun in the game.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\striker.png" alt="striker">
		<p class="name">Striker</p>
		<p>The third and final shotgun obtainable by Leon. It is the most powerful shotgun in the game. But it is best used when enemies are very close to take advantage of it's spread. The exclusuve upgrade expands the guns's capacity to 100! The shotgun itself also takes up less space. With this combination, it can be a great inventory saver.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\k7.png" alt="K7">
		<p class="name">Killer 7</p>
		<p>A magnum that must be purchased. This weapon without exclusives is more powerful than the Broken Butterfly, boasts a larger capacity, and is overall cheaper. Either way, a good weapon for bosses and stronger opponents.</p>
