		<p>Weapons</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="summary">
		<p>Note: Because this game offers infinite ammo for most weapons, I will only cover the strongest of each weapon category. Infinite ammo will be rewarded after completing the game and fully upgrading said weapon.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Combat Knife</p>
		<p>Your go-to melee weapon. While still better than the classic games, the knife here is nerfed compared to RE4. It's still very useful though.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\stunrod.png" alt="stun">
		<p class="name">Stun Rod</p>
		<p>Can it be? Another melee weapon? And available early in the game too! Its swing is slower. But it packs a greater punch than the knife. Too bad it takes up precious inventory space for more powerful weapons or health items.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\m92f.png" alt="Handgun">
		<p class="name"> M92F</p>
		<p>Chris and Sheva's starting 9mm Handgun. It is terribly low in firepower but makes up for it by including a 100 clip magazine and highest critical hit chance. But then it loses its speciality in the former with infinite ammo. Still, it is great to have until you can fully upgrade the strongest handgun.</p>
	</div>


		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\sigp226.png" alt="P226">
		<p class="name">SIG P226</p>
		<p>The most powerful handgun in the game. While it's the cheapestr to fully upgrade, its stats besides fire power are not impressive. Only use this gun when you an give it infinite ammo.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\ithacam37.png" alt="itachi">
		<p class="name">Ithaca M37</p>
		<p>A shotgun that can be obtained in chapter 1 or purchased from the shop. It is the weakest overall shotgun. But to access the strongest shotgun, you must fully upgrade this weapon. At least it's the cheapest to upgrade.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\hydra.png" alt="hydra">
		<p class="name">Hydra</p>
		<p>The BEST shotgun in the game. It has the highest firepower, highest spread, and best range in the game. If you're looking to set infinite ammo for any weapon, this is it!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\vz61.png" alt="vz61">
		<p class="name">VZ61</p>
		<p>An automatic weapon that can be obtained in chapter 1-1. Like the TMP of RE4, it is low on firepower but has a great capacity. You need to fully upgrade this weapons to gain the gattling gun however.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\ak74.png" alt="ak74">
		<p class="name">AK-74</p>
		<p>THe most powerful assault rifle in the game. Despite this, it's best to hold off on using it until you can purchase infinite ammo as recoil, reload speed, and capacity are fairly poor compared to other machine guns.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\sig556.png" alt="556">
		<p class="name">SIG 556 </p>
		<p>Another obtainable machine gun although closer to the end of the game. It is the most powerful assault rifle in the game.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\dragunovsvd.png" alt="dragunovsvd">
		<p class="name">Dragunov SVD </p>
		<p>A semi automatic rifle found in chapter 2-2. It's my personal preference. It's not the strongest. But its fire rate more than makes up for it. Especially once infinite ammo is unlocked.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\s&wm29.png" alt="s&wm29">
		<p class="name">S&W M29</p>
		<p>The first magnum of the game and found in chapter 3-1. You must fully upgrade it to unlock the second most powerful weapon in the game.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\s&wm500.png" alt="s&wm500">
		<p class="name">S&W M500</p>
		<p>The second strongest weapon in the game! You can take a guess which one is the strongest. Unlike the Handcannon, you don't need to do anything special to unlock it besides fully upgrading the above magnum.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\hgrenade.png" alt="grenade">
		<p class="name">Hand Grenade</p>
		<p>Like the last game. Throw it, it explodes. Just don't stand too close.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\igrenade.png" alt="igrenade">
		<p class="name">Incindiary Grenade</p>
		<p>Same as last game. Toss it, and watch your enemies (and yourself if too close) burn. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re4weapons\fgrenade.png" alt="fgrenade">
		<p class="name">Flash Grenade</p>
		<p>Like the last game. Toss it and blind enemies as well as killing certain enemy states.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\proxy.png" alt="pBomb">
		<p class="name">Proximity Bomb</p>
		<p>Wonderful! A Hand Grenade that blows if an enemy steps over it. Unused bombs can be retreived for later use.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\grenade.png" alt="gl">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher</p>
		<p>Making a return after taking a backseat in RE4. This weapon is one of the few weapons that lacks infinite ammo. Likely due to the fact that it uses multiple ammo types. However, this time, ammo can be purchased from the shop. Explosive, acid, freeze, and flame rounds make a return. And Electric rounds make their debut.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\eggs.png" alt="eggs">
		<p class="name">Eggs?</p>
		<p>What was once a joke weapon is now a lethal threat to some enemies. White, Brown, and Gold eggs make a return and can heal you when consumed. Eating rotten eggs will do the opposite. But they can be used to kill enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re5weapons\rpg.png" alt="rpg">
		<p class="name">Rocket Launcher</p>
		<p>The obvious most powerful weapon in the game. Like its predecessor, its single-use variant can be found in-game in once spot and later purchasable at the shop. It can be converted to an infinite Rocket Launcher by completing the game in under five hours.</p>
