	<div class="summary">
		<p>Note: Weapons are fairly basic in this game, and they cannot be upgraded. Infinite ammo is a potential reward in this game. As ammo is less plentiful, it will be a great asset in unlocking the true power weapons.</p>
		<p>Ammo can also be crafted like in RE3: Nemesis. However, it is far more limiting. Only grenade launcher rounds and handgun ammo can be crafted.</p>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name"> Pocket Knife</p>
		<p>Your go-to melee weapon! Ethan finds it useless. And he's kinda right. It will prove to have its use. But against enemies, it's an absolute last resort.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\g17.png" alt="g17">
		<p class="name">Glock 17</p>
		<p>A handgun you obtain early in the game. You must pick this up to advance. It's great to have as a starter weapon. However, there is a somewhat better handgun to obtain later on.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\m37.png" alt="M37">
		<p class="name"> M37</p>
		<p> It is the first shotgun you can obtain. To do this, you must be willing to pull a switcheroo not unlike what Chris did back in 1998. It is not the most powerful shotgun. But it has far better spread than the other.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\44mag.png" alt="44MAG">
		<p class="name">44 Magnum</p>
		<p>A magnum that can be obtained early in the game. Like other titles, ammo can be very scarce. Although this game takes this up to 11. Seriously, save this for bosses only.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\grenade.png" alt="GL">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher</p>
		<p>This weapons makes yet another return in a failry nerfed state. It only holds flame and neuro rounds and can only be fired once before reloading is needed. Ammo for it is also rare, and the component needed to craft more is also uncommon. Save it for bosses and the really tough enemies.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\bomb.png" alt="Rbomb">
		<p class="name">Remote Bomb</p>
		<p>These act like the proximity bombs from RE5. Place one somewhere, and let an enemy trip it. Just don't stand too close!</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\re7weapons\p19.png" alt="P19">
		<p class="name">P19</p>
		<p>An automatic weapon that can be obtained late in the game. It's not a very good weapon imo. But in this game, anything is still better than the knife. Use it when you other weapons are low on ammo.</p>
