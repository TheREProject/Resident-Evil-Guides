		<p>Weapons</p> 
	</div>

	<div class="summary">
		<p>Unlike other titles, there are almost no charater exclusive weapons. This means that if played correctly, Claire can weild all weapons in the game provided she makes the correct choices and it willing to take a few side trips through the optional areas.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\knife.png" alt="knife">
		<p class="name">Knife</p>
		<p>Again, this will be your go-to melee weapon. The key difference between this knife and previous knives is that this one is actually worth learning how to use. In fact, completing one of the side games requires knowing how to use the knife properly.</p>
		<p>TIP: For zombies, go for their legs. If done correctly, you'll do two swipes of damage in one. This downs and zombie instantly leaving it open for more punishment.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\clairehg.png" alt="claire's handgun">
		<p class="name">Claire's Handgun</p>
		<p>A 9mm Handgun used by Claire. It can be modified in a similar manner to Leon's handgun in RE2 and used by Chris later if the siblings want to swap weapons.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\chrishg.png" alt="chris handgun">
		<p class="name">Chris' Handgun</p>
		<p>A 9mm used by Chris. It can be modified to increase range, firepower, and piercing capabilities. Also usable by Claire if you feel like giving her a change of taste.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\shotgun.png" alt="shotgun">
		<p class="name">Shotgun</p>
		<p>A shotgun obtained and used by Chris. This time, Claire can also use it. But by that point in the game, she won't need it. Seriously, don't give her any of the strong weapons. You will regret it.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\grenade.png" alt="Grenade Launcher">
		<p class="name">Grenade Launcher</p>
		<p>A versatile weapon obtained by Claire but can be used by Chris later on. Ammo of course includes grenade, acid, and flame rounds. But it also features one of the rarest rounds in the entire series. Anti-B.O.W rounds. There are only three in the entire game without hacks, and they're oall in one place. Be sure to pack it when you can!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\maggy.png" alt="Magnum">
		<p class="name">Magnum</p>
		<p>A high grade (and easily missable) handgun obtained by Chris that is determined by Claire's actions. Either the Walkthrough or Trivia section will explain on this more. But seriously, you don't want to miss this weapon. You will feel its absence.</p>		
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\bowgun.png" alt="Bowgun">
		<p class="name">Bowgun</p>
		<p>The Bowgun makes its return in this game and is far more useful than its previous counterpart. It is a must have due to the special bowgun bolts powder that can be combined to give its ammo an extra punch to the game's various bosses and strong enemies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\mp100.png" alt="MP-100">
		<p class="name">MP-100</p>
		<p>The first set of dual weilding weapons Claire can find. It is easy to miss as the location of this weapon is entirely optional.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\sub.png" alt="submachine">
		<p class="name">Sub machine guns</p>
		<p>A pair of automatic submachine guns used by Steve with a second set obtainable by Chris depending on Claire's actions.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\sniper.png" alt="Sniper Rifle">
		<p class="name">Minethrower</p>
		<p>A scoped sniper rifle that is only usable by Claire.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="weaponpicture">
		<img src="images\recvxweapons\ar.png" alt="Assault Rifle">
		<p class="name">Assault Rifle</p>
		<p>Another automatic weapon that can be obtained and used by either Chris or Claire.</p>
	</div>
